Xatu: eXcitons from ATomistic calcUlations
=======================================================

`Xatu`_ is a computational package and library for solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) in condensed matter systems. It allows efficient and flexible exciton calculations starting from electronic structures obtained via tight-binding or DFT using localized orbitals.

The BSE is constructed from user-defined input and then diagonalized to obtain the excitonic spectrum. The results can be post-processed to extract physical properties such as optical absorption and exciton localization.
